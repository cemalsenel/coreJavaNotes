/*
   1) All methods in an interface must be abstract
      Putting "abstract" keyword or not putting "abstract" keyword are same
      
   2) All methods in an interface must be public
       Putting "public" keyword or not putting "public" keyword are same
       In an interface, if you do not see "access modifier" for a method,
       it is public, not default
       
   3) In an interface, variables are "public", "static" and "final" as default.
      No need to type "public" , "static" and final" for variables
      
   4) In an interface we have uncompleted methods(abstract methods) because of that Java does not let 
      us to create objects by using interfaces.
      Because of the same reason we cannot create objects by using abstract classes.
      
      Note : interfaces do not have constructors
             abstract classes have constructors but the constructors are not used to create objects.
